<h1>PHP</h1>
<h4>GiftDibs.com</h4>
<p>GiftDibs is a personal project on which I've spent many years. It is a social site that helps families share gift ideas for major gift-giving holidays.</p>
<p>The entire site is written by hand so that I could learn the inner workings of PHP/MySQL, and learn how to create my own backend framework and APIs.</p>
<h4>WordPress Plugins</h4>
<p>The plugins prefixed with "blackbaud" were built as a suite for my current employer. They feature automatic updates, a PHP namespace, and a reusable class-based structure.</p>
<h5>Newseum</h5>
<p>This plugin was built for a Blackbaud client, Newseum, which displays their newspaper feed in an easy-to-digest format. You can see it in action, <a href="http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
