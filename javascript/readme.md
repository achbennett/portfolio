<h1>JavaScript</h1>
<h4>BBI Namespace</h4>
<p>This project is in current use by my employer, Blackbaud. It was built to give our JavaScript developers a consistent framework to develop all of our cross-platform customizations.</p>
<p>It features a module-focused structure, an asset-loader, and easily integrates with other frameworks such as AngularJS.</p>
<h4>Angular NetCommunity Custom Part</h4>
<p>This project was completed for one of Blackbaud's clients. It uses AngularJS for the user interface, pulling models from Blackbaud's NetCommunity CMS.</p>
<p>The tool was built to give non-developers a way to add filterable select inputs on donation forms.</p>
<h4>Angular Station</h4>
<p>This is an ongoing personal project. I wanted to learn AngularJS and so decided to make a game entirely with the framework.</p>
<h4>BBNC (NetCommunity) Localization</h4>
<p>This jQuery plugin was developed to localize English NetCommunity forms into French or Spanish. The plugin pulls the data from a JSON file, and replaces the keywords on the DOM.</p>
