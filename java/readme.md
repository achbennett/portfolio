<h1>Java</h1>
<p>I'm fairly new to Java, but sometimes its strictness is a breath of fresh air to the loose-typed JavaScript.</p>
<h4>KeyRunner</h4>
<p>This was a simple program written to test a game character's movement and animation from a sprite sheet. It uses advanced calculations to make sure the framerate stays true to the animated frames.</p>
<h4>School Projects</h4>
<p>This folder stores all of my class projects and assignments. Not too interesting, but it's something. Each classes' Final Project folder include assignments that demonstrate the stuff I learned during the entire semester.</p>
